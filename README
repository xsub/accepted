Overview
--------
With no --strict `accepted` expectes --stdyes strings or strings added with '+' prefix as arguments this results in returning ACCEPTED.
Any not listed string get REJECTED. 'rejected' expect --stdyes or strings added with '-' as arguemnts to return REJECTED, otherwise if no --strict applied it returns ACCEPTED. 


Example usage (in Bash-like script)

bash$ [ accepted -yes $answer] && do_it



Compilation:
------------

autoreconf --install
./configure
make

0. --stdyes, --stdno

1. Solo-operation mode (doing actual prompt in accepted/rejected code).

Example 1.
[ accepted --S --strict --stdmin "Do you want to" ] && do_it
Will render to console: "Do you want to (y/n)? " and accept 'y', 'Y', 'n', 'N' as valid input.

Example 2.
[ accepted --S --strict --stdmax "Do you want to" ] && do_it
Will render to console: "Do you want to (y/n/yes/no/yup/nah/yeah/nope)? " and accept any of showed answers, ignoring case.



--S: 		solo-operation: no need to do 'read' and pass the answer, aditionally the passed prompt is printed with all variants of answers.
--strict:	this makes the input prompt accept only listed strings.
